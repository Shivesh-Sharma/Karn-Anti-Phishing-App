Karn Anti-Phishing App is a powerful open-source tool that provides protection against phishing attacks. Phishing is a common cyber-attack technique that involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by impersonating a trusted entity.

Karn Anti-Phishing App is designed to detect and block phishing attempts in real-time. It uses advanced algorithms to analyze the content of web pages and emails and identify suspicious links and attachments. The app then displays a warning message to the user, preventing them from falling victim to the attack.

The app is easy to use and can be installed on various devices, including desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. It also provides customizable settings to adjust the level of protection and notifications according to the user's preferences.

Karn Anti-Phishing App is open-source, meaning that its source code is freely available to anyone who wants to contribute to its development or customize it to suit their needs. Its Github repository provides detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples, making it easy for developers to integrate it into their projects.

By using Karn Anti-Phishing App, users can protect themselves against phishing attacks and avoid becoming victims of identity theft, financial fraud, and other cybercrimes.
## Dataset Description
The dataset contains two folders:

urldata - This folder contains CSV files of various phishing URLs and their associated features. These features include the domain name, URL length, the presence of symbols, the presence of redirection, etc.

Each CSV file contains two columns: URL and Label. The URL column lists the URLs, and the Label column indicates whether the URL is phishing (bad) or not phishing (0).
